ZAML is faster YAML serialization for Ruby

The Ruby YAML library is a full stack standard compliant
implementation of the YAML protocol, while ZAML is an attempt to
produce (effectively) the same output as YAML would have - but much
faster and with cleaner code.

ZAML has been benchmarked at up to %1600 faster than YAML:
